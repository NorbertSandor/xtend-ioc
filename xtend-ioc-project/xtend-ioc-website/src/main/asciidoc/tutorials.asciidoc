== Installing requirements

Before creating an xtend-ioc project you would need the following prerequisites:

* Install Java. +
Although a JRE is sufficient, for development it is better to have a http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html[JDK] installed.
* Install Eclipse. +
I recommend using the http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[Eclipse Installer].
* Start Eclipse and install the http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/download.html[Xtend plugin]. +
Use the http://download.eclipse.org/modeling/tmf/xtext/updates/composite/milestones/[Milestones update site] for installing the plugin.
* Optionally, you need http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] if you plan to build your project from the command line as well.
